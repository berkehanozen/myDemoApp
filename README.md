This project is about learning how to use GitHub, Travis, Heroku together in an effective way while creating an app. In this project we created a sample app where given 2 integer arrays, a string array and two integers, we use the two integers as indexes in the integer arrays to get the values residing in those indexes of the integer arrays. After getting these two integers, we once again use them as indexes on the string array so that we swap the strings on the indexes those integers show. We then increase the smaller one by 1 while decreasing the larger one by 1 and once again swap the strings at the indexes these new integers show. We continue doing this until we finish swapping every string between the indexes that we initially obtained from the integer arrays.
